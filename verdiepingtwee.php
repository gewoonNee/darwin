	<br><br>"Macroevolution" is devoted to the origin and development of life on the Earth from a molecule up to Man. You will learn who inhabited landscapes of distant geological epochs, who the deep ancestor of Man looked like, and how his evolution, as well as his relationship to Nature, has been developing at different times.
Here you will also discover ethology - a science about animal behaviour.
